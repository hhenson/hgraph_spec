Scalar types
============

Status: draft. See [Evidence](https://github.com/hhenson/hgraph_spec_audit/blob/main/runtime/evidence.md) for implementation status.

A scalar value is a piece of data with no time in it. It is what a
time-series carries from one tick to the next, what a node is configured
with, and what a node keeps as state. "Scalar" here means *not a
time-series*; it does not mean small — a map of structs is a scalar value.


Concept
-------

- **Consumers receive stable read-only values; mutation requires owner
  authority.** A node reading an input or a function passed an ordinary
  argument receives recursively read-only access. An owner with writable
  access may change a value or explicitly
  lend bounded mutable owner access. That live owner access observes its
  own changes; it is not a stable consumer snapshot. An output is changed
  only by its own node during evaluation, preserving the consumer's stable
  observation from the end of that evaluation through the cycle.
- **To keep a value is to copy it.** A view is good for the cycle in which it
  was obtained, or a shorter lifetime specified by its provider. Anything
  retained beyond its borrowed lifetime — a node's state, a value
  written on to another output — holds a **copy**, which is an independent
  value that nothing else will change. How cheap a copy is, and whether one
  is physically made, is an implementation's business; that the holder
  cannot see later changes is the contract.
- **Every value has a type, and a type has an identity.** Two descriptions of
  the same type are the same type, wherever they were written. Identity is
  what lets wiring check an edge, a stored graph description be loaded, and
  two processes agree about what they exchange.
- **Types are resolved before anything runs.** A generic node is written
  against type variables; by the end of wiring every variable has a concrete
  type. Nothing in a running graph is generic, and no value is of an
  undetermined type — except inside an **any**, which exists for exactly
  that.
- **Nil is the one representation of no value.** It is what an unset field
  holds, what an invalid time-series gives, and what an empty **any** holds.

### The atomic types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `bool` | True or false |
| `i64` | A 64-bit signed integer |
| `f64` | A 64-bit floating-point number |
| `str` | Text |
| `bytes` | Uninterpreted bytes |
| `date` | A calendar date, with no zone |
| `time` | A time of day, with no zone |
| `datetime` | An instant on the UTC timeline, to the microsecond. The type of evaluation time |
| `duration` | A length of time, in microseconds |
| `civil_datetime` | A date and time of day as read from a wall clock, with no zone and therefore not an instant |
| `timezone` | A named time zone |
| `zoned_datetime` | An instant together with its zone and the offset that zone gave it |
| `zoned_time` | A time of day in a named zone |
| an **enum** | A named type with a fixed, ordered list of named members, each with an integer |
| a **native atomic** | A type supplied from outside the language, opaque to it, brought in with whatever capabilities it declares |

### The composite kinds

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **tuple** | A fixed number of values, each of its own type, by position |
| **struct** | Named fields, each of its own type. The scalar counterpart of a bundle |
| **list** | Values of one type, in order; of a fixed length or any length |
| **set** | Distinct values of one type, in no order |
| **map** | Distinct keys of one type, each with a value of another |
| **any** | A value of whatever type it is given, or nil. The value carries its type with it |

### Value access and storage

An ordinary value has one canonical type regardless of whether its binding
permits mutation. Writable owner access permits admitted content changes;
read-only access recursively prevents them. An independent owning copy has
the same type and no shared mutable children observable by its source.

Physical mutable and compact read-only representations may differ without
creating different HGL value types. A provider promising writable access must
supply storage that supports it, even when a value originated in a read-only
representation. Consumers receive read-only observations, not that authority.

The [HGL value-mutability contract](../language/docs/design/value-mutability.md)
uses `let` for read-only access and `var` for writable access, and specifies
lexical global-entry borrowing. It adds no source mutation operation for a
container kind that has no admitted operation. The separate
[ordinary-list contract](../language/docs/design/ordinary-list-values.md)
admits typed empty construction, length, indexed reads and independently
retained end growth; [its cases](cases_ordinary_lists.md) cover those rules.

### Structs

A struct is **nominal**: its identity is its name, qualified by where it was
declared, together with its type arguments if it is generic. Two structs with
the same fields and different names are different types. A tuple, by
contrast, is **structural**: its identity is the types of its positions.

A field may be **optional**, meaning it may be left unset and hold nil. A
field that is not optional has a value in every complete struct, either given
or from its default.

A struct may **contain itself**: a field may be of the struct's own type, or
of another struct that leads back to it — a list node, a tree, an expression.
Such a field is always optional, since a struct that had to contain another
of itself could never be finished; nil is where the structure ends. A value
built this way is always a finite tree. It is compared, hashed, ordered and
copied all the way down.

Structs may form **families**. An **abstract** struct is never constructed;
it declares fields that its descendants share. A concrete struct is always a
leaf. A position typed as an abstract struct holds a value of exactly one of
its concrete descendants, and the value knows which. The family is
**closed**: the set of concrete members is fixed when wiring ends, and a
graph does not see members that appear later.

### From scalar types to time-series types

A time-series type is built from scalar types (see Time-series types): a TS
carries one scalar type, a TSS its element type, a TSD a key type and a child
time-series type. HGL derives the time-series type *from* the scalar type —
a struct becomes a bundle, a map a dictionary of time-series, a list a list
of time-series — and `atomic<T>` stops the derivation, giving one TS that
carries the whole of `T`. That derivation is the compiler's business. What
the runtime sees is its result.

```

*Container* stands for list, set and map.

- A value **is of** exactly one type. An **any** is of type *any* and holds a
  value that is of its own type.
- A composite type **refers to** the types of its parts. Types may be nested
  to any depth.
- A struct **inherits from** any number of abstract structs, never from a
  concrete one.


State
-----

A value has no state beyond its content. Changing it requires owner or
explicitly delegated mutable access. A **type** holds:

| Item | For | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| kind | every type | Atomic, tuple, struct, list, set, map, any |
| name | enums, structs, native atomics | The qualified name that is the type's identity |
| parts | composites | Position types; fields (name, type, optional or not, default); element type; key and value types; fixed length or capacity |
| members | enums | The ordered members, each a name and an integer |
| parents | structs | The abstract structs it inherits from |
| abstract | structs | Whether it can be constructed |
| capabilities | every type | Which of the optional operations below its values support |

### Capabilities

Every value can be **copied** and turned into **text**. Three further
operations are optional, and a type either has each or does not:

| Capability | Means | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| **equality** | Two values can be compared for being the same | Set elements; map keys |
| **hash** | A value can be used as a key | Set elements; map keys; the elements of a TSS; the keys of a TSD |
| **order** | Two values can be compared for which comes first. May be partial | Sorting, and the comparison operators |

The [Boolean and zone scalar capability index](../language/docs/design/bool-scalar-capabilities.md)
records bool equality/hash/total order and the existing zone equality/hash
without order.

A composite has a capability when its parts allow it:

| Kind | equality | hash | order |
|---|---|---|---|
| tuple, struct | every part has it | every part has it | every part has it |
| list | the element has it | the element has it | the element has it |
| set | the element has equality and hash | the element has equality and hash | never |
| map | the key has equality and hash | and the value has hash too | never |
| any | claimed; may fail when used | claimed; may fail when used | claimed; may fail when used |

An **any** cannot know what it will hold, so it claims every capability and
fails at the point of use if the value inside lacks one.


Behaviour
---------

- **Equality.** Values of different types are not equal. Two structs are
  equal when they are the same concrete struct and their fields are equal;
  two values of an abstract type are equal only if they are the same concrete
  member. Set and map equality ignore order. Unset equals unset.
- **Hash.** Equal values have equal hashes. A set's hash does not depend on
  the order its elements were added. Asking for the hash of a value that has
  none is an error, not a default.
- **Order.** Unset comes before set. An enum orders by its members'
  integers. Values of an abstract type order only within the same concrete
  member. A set or a map has no order.
- **Text.** Every value has a text form. An enum's is its member's name. A
  set or a map has no order, so its text lists its members in no specified
  order, and equal sets or maps may render differently (ruling 2026-09-24).
  A type, held as a value, is written as its name: `int`, `TS[int]`
  (RFC 0042).
- **Constructing a struct.** Fields are given by name. A field not given
  takes its default; a field with no default must be given unless it is
  optional, in which case it is unset. A struct built with nothing given and
  every field optional is entirely unset.
- **Time arithmetic** is checked. A result outside the representable range
  is an error; it never wraps.
- **Identity.** Declaring a type that already exists gives the existing
  type. Declaring an enum or a struct under a name already in use, with a
  different definition, is an error.


Rules
-----

- **VAL-1** Content mutation requires writable owner access or explicitly
  authorized mutable owner access. Ordinary input and parameter access is
  recursively read-only. Access permission does not change a value's type.
- **VAL-2** The same description of a type, given twice, is one type.
- **VAL-3** A struct or enum is identified by its qualified name and type
  arguments; a tuple by the types of its positions. A named type never equals
  an unnamed one. Binding and access permissions are not part of type identity.
- **VAL-4** Generic struct types with different type arguments are different
  types, and neither is a subtype of the other.
- **VAL-5** Re-declaring a named type with a different definition is an
  error.
- **VAL-6** No value in a running graph has an unresolved type.
- **VAL-7** Equal values have equal hashes.
- **VAL-8** Set and map equality and hash do not depend on order.
- **VAL-9** A composite type has equality, hash or order exactly as the
  capability table says.
- **VAL-10** A TSS element type and a TSD key type must have equality and
  hash. This is checked when the type is formed, not when a value arrives.
- **VAL-11** Asking a value for an operation its type lacks is an error.
- **VAL-12** Unset equals unset and orders before set. A struct constructed
  with nothing given is unset in every optional field.
- **VAL-13** An enum's values order by their integers, and its text is the
  member's name.
- **VAL-14** A value of an abstract type is of exactly one concrete member,
  fixed when it was made. The members of a family are fixed when wiring ends.
- **VAL-15** Time arithmetic that leaves the representable range is an error.
- **VAL-16** A consumer's read-only value observation is stable for the
  cycle within its admitted lifetime. Explicit borrowed owner access is live
  access, not that consumer snapshot; it ends at its specified scope and
  cannot be retained as a read-only snapshot by merely dropping write access.
- **VAL-17** A value kept beyond the cycle in which it was read is an owning
  copy. The copy is independent recursively: no later change to the original
  or its children is visible through it. Its canonical value type is
  preserved. Keeping a borrowed handle is not copying a value.
- **VAL-18** A struct may have a field of its own type, directly or through
  other structs. Every such field is optional. Equality, hash, order and copy
  follow the whole depth of the value.


Deferred
--------

- **Serial forms.** hgraph has a binary form and a JSON form, registered per
  atomic type. They are needed for recording, replay and distribution, and
  go with those.
- **Physical representation of mutable values and copies.** Storage layout,
  physical sharing and copy elision are implementation choices provided
  that mutability, access authority and independent retention obey
  VAL-1, VAL-16 and VAL-17.
- **Cyclic buffer and queue.** hgraph has both as value kinds. They exist to
  implement windows (TSW) — they are the changing store behind one, not
  values a graph passes around — and so are an implementation's concern.
- **Shared and owned handles** to struct values. hgraph uses a shared handle
  to avoid copying large values, and an owned one-pointer handle as the way a
  struct holds a field of its own type. Both are mechanisms: VAL-18 is the
  concept the second one serves.
- **Values belonging to a language bridge**, such as an arbitrary Python
  object. They are **any**-kind values whose capabilities the bridge
  supplies.
- **Library scalars**: narrower integers and floats, periods, ranges of dates
  and instants, data frames and series. Each is a native atomic or a struct
  as far as this chapter is concerned.
- **Types as values**: a type passed as a node's scalar, to select behaviour
  at wiring time. It matters to wiring, not to a running graph.


Points to settle
----------------

1. **Arithmetic the language has not settled.** HGL leaves open `i64`
   overflow, integer division and remainder on negative operands, division by
   zero at run time, and how `NaN` compares. hgraph's own arithmetic table is
   the reference until it does. These are operator questions, but the answers
   fix what `i64` and `f64` *are*.
2. **Strings.** Ordering, indexing, length and normalisation of `str` are
   undefined in HGL.
3. **An unknown enum integer.** hgraph's native text form falls back to the
   number; HGL rejects the value. A runtime that receives one from outside —
   a recording, another process — needs one answer.
4. **Clearing an optional field through a delta.** In a bundle's delta an
   absent field means "no change", so there is no way to say "this optional
   field is now unset". HGL rejects the attempt until there is.
5. **Field order with several abstract parents.** Field order is part of a
   struct's identity as data; hgraph and HGL both leave the order across
   multiple parents undecided.
6. **Map equality.** As read from hgraph's type registry, a map has equality
   when its *key* has equality and hash; the value type is not mentioned. It
   presumably has to have equality too. The capability table follows the
   registry and should be checked.
7. **Recursive fields across modules.** VAL-18 and HGL ADRs 0012 and 0013
   govern local and imported recursive types. A recursive edge is optional
   and atomic, so temporalization terminates. Direct and mutual recursion
   are admitted; recursion through containers remains excluded by ADR 0012.
